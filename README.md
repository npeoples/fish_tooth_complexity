RevBayes scripts needed to reproduce the analyses in Peoples et al. "Evolutionary Lability of a Key Innovation Spurs Rapid Diversification in Fishes".

RevBayes v1.2.1 (Windows) can be downloaded from Github (https://github.com/revbayes/revbayes/releases). 
To execute the RevBayes scripts, first navigate to the RevBayes directory in the command-line interface. Open a RevBayes process using 'rb'. Set the working directory using setwd("INSERT PATH HERE)". RevBayes scripts can be executed using "source(FILENAME.Rev)", provided the scripts and data are in the same folder.
